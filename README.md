# Comfy Drive
A desktop-feeling web app for managing files on a server. Uses the [comfy-api](https://github.com/geoctrl/comfy-api) as the backend.

### Reasoning
Sharing anything on the web requires your stuff to be uploaded on to someone else's server (Gmail, Facebook, etc). Comfy Drive allows you to use your own server and domain to gain access and manage files. You can even install this on your own personal computer and give remote users access.

### Current Features
 - basic UI for file management

### Roadmap
 - desktop functionality for file management
 - google doc-like collaboration
 - user management and security
